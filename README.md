# Dice-Number-Project

# Project description: 
Building the random dice game with simple UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game rule is simple, the winner is determined by the amount of the dice is randomly choose. The winner is the one with larger number, and the game is draw whenever two dices is the same. 


# Step 1:
Buidling HTML and CSS to add structures and styles of the webpage. Specifically, I added two img tags and with source of dice 6. For CSS, I styled with background color and center the whole container to make website add readability and consistency.  

# Step 2: Writing JavaScript simple algorithm to random the dice number. Each number corresponding with the dice image, such as number one is image of dice 1. Moreover, the winner is also set for one with higher number. In that case, I changed to title from the name of the game to the name of the winner.  

# Step 3: Testing and debugging code to maintain the game runs properly.
